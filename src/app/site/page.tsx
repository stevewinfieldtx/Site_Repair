On a beach as a teenager, the artist Yves Klein and two friends decided, like Greek gods, to divide up the realms. One got the sea, another the earth, and Klein the sky. Here by the Mediterranean’s shores, he complained about the gulls stealing his vision, tearing through the azure overhead. “I began to feel hatred,” he wrote later, “for the birds which flew back and forth across my blue sky, cloudless sky, because they tried to bore holes in my greatest and most beautiful work.” Soon the sky became his domain. He went on to trademark a shade of blue. International Klein Blue was modeled on lapis lazuli. In 1957 he declared that we’d entered the Époque Bleue, the blue age. I think of him now, claiming the sky, hating the birds, calling that blue above his best work, as I consider different skies, different blues, different realms. These too are divvied up and doled out. They appear on the internet and our computers and phones, where blue is the most common color, as if that blue, the époque bleue, has only just dawned.

I started pondering this blue age as an accident. I stared at my screen, a proverbial window, facing an actual window as I stood at my desk. I was writing, hence easily distracted. I noticed the icons for different apps lined up in the dock, as Apple calls it. Scrolling left to right, there was the Finder’s square smiley face, a cubist rendering in two blues, the face split like Picasso’s Demoiselles, shrunk to a half-inch square. The App Store, iChat, Mail, and Safari veered close to Klein’s luminescent lapis. Microsoft Word was turquoise with shadows in the folds of the W, as if to trick me into believing it had dimensionality, and the few apps that were white or gray took on a blue cast from the LED screen. On the document I wrote in, the formatting was blue, the margins marked in blue. An hour later I started an email, and the recipients’ names came in two different blues: a pale one indicating the To line, while, as I typed the email address, Mail helpfully offered a list of names in navy to jog my memory. And online, links were blue. I returned to my writing but couldn’t escape the blues. I highlighted text to delete it and start my sentence over, and this, too, was the same aching blue of a winter’s sky in the Catskills, where I live.

I tried to work, told myself not to think of these hues, but the blues did something to me. I couldn’t shake them. It was the spring of my mother’s death, and

I am seeing differences between Firefox, Chrome and Safari regarding how gradients with the "longer hue" interpolation method are rendered. I think I understand what the spec expects, but none of the browsers tested get this right, so I'd like to confirm my interpretation —and perhaps some clarification or additional examples may be needed in the spec.
Testcase:[https://codepen.io/jfkthame/pen/azopZOx]
(Note that there have been some recent patches to gradient rendering in Firefox. The description below refers to current Nightly builds; older versions have some different and less self-consistent results.)
This renders a number of 100px-wide gradient swatches, all of them defined as linear-gradient(to right in hsl longer hue, ...) with two color stops, red and blue, at a variety of positions. (The red and blue tick-marks above and below each swatch indicate the positions of the color stops defining the gradient.)
Results I'm seeing in Firefox Nightly, Chrome Canary, and Safari Tech Preview:
[![image]]
The simplest case is (a), with the red stop at the left edge and the blue stop at the right. No issues here: we simply render a gradient from red to blue, going "the long way around" the HSL w

Perpetuity Blues **a novelette** _by_ **Neal Barrett, Jr** On Maggie's seventh birthday, she found the courage to ask Mother what had happened to her father. "Your father disappeared under strange circumstances," said Mother. "Sorghumdances?" said Maggie. "Circumstances," said Mother, who had taught remedial English before marriage and was taking a stab at it again. "Circumstances: a condition or fact attending an event or having some bearing upon it." "I see," said Maggie. She didn't, but knew it wasn't safe to ask twice. What happened was Daddy got up after supper one night and put on his cardigan with the patches on the sleeves and walked to the 7-Eleven for catfood and bread. Eight months later, he hadn't shown up or called or written a card. Strange circumstances didn't seem like a satisfactory answer. Mother died Thursday afternoon.

"There's no telling who he might of met at that store," said Aunt Grace. "Your father wasn't right after the service. I expect he got turned in Berlin.
